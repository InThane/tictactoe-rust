# tictactoe-rust
Rust-based implementation of tic-tac-toe

A long time ago in seventh grade, my Computers teacher encouraged me to make a tic-tac-toe "computer" out of matchboxes, skittles, and M&Ms. Since then, I've used tic-tac-toe as a way to teach myself new programming languages. This is my pass at Rust.
